**Q1**. How many possible orientations can two parallel spins adopt with respect to the external magnetic field? Show by schematic diagram.

**Q2**. What are the spin multiplicity and the spin of triplet state?

**Q3**. Why two electrons are always present in two different orbitals of the molecule in triplet state?

**Q4**. Internal conversion (takes place at a time scale of 10-12 s) is faster than the fluorescence emission. Then how does radiative emission (fluorescence) compete with the non-radiative transition? (Hint: Significantly larger energy gap between S1 and S0 and longer lifetime of S1.)

**Q5**. Transitions between states of different multiplicity are formally forbidden. What are the mechanisms that make the intersystem crossing probable?

**Q6**. How can you justify that the relaxation to ground state occurs via 'vertical' transition?

**Q7**. In most of the cases, the S1 potential energy curve shifts to the right with respect to S0 potential energy curve. Justify it. (Hint: In the excited state, the electron is promoted to an anti-bonding orbital.)

**Q8**. Why are absorption and fluorescence much faster than phosphorescence?
